# Web Workers

Web Workers let you run JavaScript code on separate threads, away from the main page’s execution. This means that heavy tasks—like large data processing or complex calculations—can happen in the background without freezing the user interface. By offloading demanding work to these “worker” threads, your site stays responsive and user-friendly, even if something goes wrong or takes a long time to finish.

In this Repo, you'll find a few different examples demonstrating how to use Web Workers

* **simple web worker** - Demonstrates the basic communication protocol for web workers.
* **delayed web worker** - Demonstrates heavy computations and how they affect the critical rendering path.
